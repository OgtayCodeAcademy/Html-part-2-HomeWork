            At least 19,000 people have now fled the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and found refuge in Armenia,
            according to the country's government.
            Thousands have been fleeing across the border since Azerbaijan defeated the separatists who have governed
            the breakaway region for about 30 years in a swift military operation last week.

            If you’re in the Eurozone and you want to buy the top of the range iPhone, it’s going to cost you more than
            buyers across the pond.
            Converted into euros, the price displayed on Apple’s US website starts at €1131.74 for the iPhone 15 Pro
            Max, which went on sale last weekend.
            This is a price hike of around 9% compared to last year’s version, but for European consumers, Americans are
            arguably bagging a bargain.</p>

            Georges Feydeau (1862–1921) was a French playwright of the Belle Époque era, remembered for his farces. His
            first full-length comedy, Tailleur pour dames ('Ladies' tailor'), was well-received.

            After studying earlier masters of French comedy, particularly Eugène Labiche, Alfred Hennequin and Henri
            Meilhac, he wrote or collaborated on seventeen full-length plays between 1892 and 1914, many of which have
            become staples of the theatrical repertoire in France and abroad.</p>
